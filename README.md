# Character Generator 
This is a simple React based web app for generating random characters for roleplaying games or any other need of fictional persons. 

The app provides the following functionality: 
* User-fillable input fields for the character's first name, last name, age and profession. 
* Fill in any random fields by retrieving random values from the node server. 
* Clear all the fields. 
* Randomize all the fields, regardless of if they are empty or not.
